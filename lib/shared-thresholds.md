## Subagent enforcement (paperflow-thresholds v1)

paperflow's orchestrator delegates non-trivial work to subagents. The rule has hard thresholds and a pre-write checkpoint — not just guidance.

**Hard thresholds** — above ANY of these, the orchestrator MUST dispatch a subagent:

- **> 30 LOC** of new code (across all files in one logical unit)
- **> 50 lines** of new prose / markdown
- **> 500 tokens** of raw tool output captured / synthesised

**Bash-glue carve-out**: bash glue scripts ≤ **25 LOC** stay inline. Other languages (JS, Python, etc.) hold the 30 LOC gate.

**Pre-write checkpoint**: before any inline `Write` or `Edit` of more than 30 LOC of code OR 50 lines of prose, the orchestrator prints a one-line justification:

    Doing inline because: <reason>. Above threshold would be <subagent-reason>.

Visible self-correction, not silent inlining.

**Recursion depth = 1**: subagent briefs themselves are orchestrator-direct, no matter their length. The orchestrator can write a 600-token brief without dispatching to write the brief — otherwise infinite recursion.

**Verification-subagent dispatch**: when a subagent returns artifacts > 500 tokens of evidence (diffs, test output, screenshots), `/paperflow:build` dispatches a SECOND subagent — a verification-subagent — to inspect the evidence and confirm the gate passes. The orchestrator only sees a one-line verdict.

**Commit-message marker**: any commit touching > 30 LOC includes a structured trailer:

    Subagent-Run: <task-id>

`bin/paperflow-audit-orchestrator-budget` flags over-threshold commits that lack this trailer.

**Always orchestrator-direct (exempt list)** — never dispatch a subagent for:

- Beads bookkeeping (`bd create / claim / close / update --description`)
- Pointer-file writes (`<repo>/.paperflow/active-{goal,phase}`)
- `Read` (always free)
- Short verification commands (`curl` probes, `find … | wc -l`, single-shot greps)
- Single-line edits to live docs to bump pointers / status
- Snapshot writes that change ≤ 5 lines of an existing HTML
- `bd` comments and `bd update --description` (any size)
- Pasting verbatim subagent output (the subagent already did the work)
- Bash glue scripts ≤ 25 LOC (carve-out above)

When in doubt, dispatch.
